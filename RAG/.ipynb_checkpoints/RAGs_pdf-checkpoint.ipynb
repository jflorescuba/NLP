Thus, we can exactly describe the\\nmotion of any two plates relative to each other by some angular rotation velocity about a\\npole located somewhere on the Earth. This pole is not tied to the Earth's pole of rotation.\\nThat is, the rotation of two plates is relative only to each other; it is not related to a fixed\\nreference frame within the Earth, such as the Earth's rotation axis. We can prove that\\nEulerian geometry holds for the motion of, for example, North America versus Africa.\\nFirst we locate the direction of transform faults marking the sea-floor spreading motion\\nof Africa away from North America. These will define latitudes, or small circles about\\nthe pole of rotation. Then we draw longitudes, or great circles perpendicular to these lines\\nof latitude. Euler predicts that these great circles intersect at two and only two points on\\nthe globe, the poles of rotation for the two plates. Sure enough, the real data converge\\nupon a point just south of Greenland. There is another pole on the exact opposite side of\\nthe Earth. Euler further predicts that the velocity of separation wil1 vary with angular\\ndistance from the pole, and this turns out also to be true.\\n\", 'The same test can be applied to every plate with a sea-floor spreading or\\ntransform-fault boundary with another plate. But Eulerian geometry also predicts that\\nthree plates must be in contact many places in the world. Similar geometric laws allow us\\nto vector sum around such “triple junctions” to determine the relative motion of three\\nplates in contact. Consider the easiest of such junctions: where three spreading centers\\nintersect. If we know the direction and velocity of opening of any two of them, we can\\nuniquely determine the velocity and direction of motion of the third relative to the other\\ntwo.\\n', '7\\n', '© Roger N.

But it is important to realize that the continent- ocean transition is\\nan insignificant barrier compared to the thickness of a lithospheric plate. Therefore, a\\ncontinent-ocean boundary can occur well within any single plate, and in general such\\nedges of continents have little to do with plate boundaries! The continents are, however,\\nlarge enough to weigh down plates that contain significant surface area of continent, but\\nthe continental crust is insignificant compared to the dimensions of a plate (greater than\\n100 km thick and often several thousand kilometers across). That is, plates with\\ncontinents appear to move more slowly than those without, such as the Pacific plate; but\\nthey still move by the same geometric laws.\\n', 'Plate tectonics is a powerful geological tool because it is predictive. One can\\n', \"determine the type of plate boundary interactions by studying the focal mechanisms of\\nearthquakes, for example. North American-Pacific plate interaction can be determined by\\nstudying the orientation of the fault planes along this boundary (Figure 3-7). These\\nearthquake mechanisms have distinct orientations that tell in what direction the plates are\\nconverging or diverging. They are of different form, depending upon whether the fault\\nmotion causing the earthquake was tensional (a gravity, or normal, fault in which the\\nmotion is in the same direction as gravity's pull), compressional (a thrust fault caused by\\ncollision where motion appears to be against gravity), or strike-slip (as the name implies,\\none plate slides across the other).  Sound familiar (Figure 3-3)? Earthquake focal\\nmechanisms can be used equally well to determine the pole of rotation of Pacific-North\\nAmerica motion, as transform faults determined North America-African plate motion in\\nthe previous example.\\n\", 'Figure 3-7.

Anderson\\n', 'Seismology and Plate Tectonics\\n', \"When an earthquake happens, the Earth shakes with a precise pattern to its\\nvibrations – a pattern controlled by the type of earthquake that it is. The initial, outgoing\\nwave of energy from the break along a fault is called a compressional wave (also called\\nthe primary or P-wave) because the particles in the Earth push and pull each other as the\\nvibration passes directly away from the break (think of it as shaking exactly away from,\\nthen toward, the location of the earthquake like ripples on a pond moving away from a\\npebble-impact). The second form of vibration is a shear wave (also known as the\\nsecondary or S-wave), so called because the Earth transmits the shear vibrations by a\\nsideways motion, moving perpendicular to the expanding shear waves. This wave is\\nimportant because solid must be in contact with solid for a shear wave to pass. If liquid\\nexists anywhere within the Earth, shear waves will be absent for the portion of the wave's\\npath that crosses through that region.\\n\", 'Waves going directly through the center of the Earth have very slow velocities as\\nthey pass through the outer core because part of that path is through the liquid iron core.\\nNot only do shear waves disappear there, but compressional waves are slowed by the\\n“softness” of the liquid as well. That is, the time it takes for the P-wave to pass through\\nthe Earth appears to be slow because the liquid outer core absorbs all shear and some\\ncompressional energy and thus slows down even the P-wave. But it then speeds up again\\nin the solid iron inner core, before slowing again thru the outer liquid core on its way\\nback to the earths surface on the other side of the planet.\\n', ' The lithospheric plates that form surface layer of the Earth are fast transmitters of\\nshear waves, and thus rigid and solid. However, only a few hundred kilometers below the\\nsurface, a slow velocity is observed everywhere from the partially liquid upper mantle.\\nLithospheric plates vary in thickness with their oceanic portions sometimes less than 100\\nkm thick and continental segments sometimes over 300 km thick.\\n', 'Low velocity seismic waves are found wherever there is molten rock, but not\\n', 'much is required – even 1 percent melt and 99% solid rock . Even that scant amount is\\nenough to eliminate shear waves and slow down P-waves.

Examples are\\nGuam in the west Pacific where the Pacific plate is subducting beneath the Philippine\\nplate and the Sandwich Islands between South America and Antarctica where the Atlantic\\nplate is subducting beneath the Scotia plate (Figure 3-16).\\n', 'Figure 3-16. Island arcs can be seen in the western Pacific (upper left) and the southern Atlantic (lower\\nright) where subduction is of an oceanic plate beneath another oceanic plate.\\n', 'Island arcs are the early beginnings of new continents. They are arcuate (curved)\\nbecause the subducting slab is a plane penetrating into a sphere. The surface expressions\\nof volcanic plumes moving directly to the surface from such a plane define an arc.\\nVolcanoes appear at the surface spaced about 100 km apart. That is the segregation\\ndistance for the production of enough magma along the slab to produce individual\\nmagma diapirs, which then congeal and move upward to the surface. If volcanism\\ncontinues, enough rock is extruded to completely fill all the space between individual\\nvolcanoes to the point that sea level is exceeded even between volcanoes and a new\\ncontinent appears.\\n', '22\\n', '© Roger N. Anderson\\n', 'There are other processes active above the subduction zone that add rock onto the\\n', 'island arc to fatten it into a small continent.  A remarkable phenomenon often occurs\\neven farther landward from the trench than the volcanic arc. Sea-floor spreading begins\\nlandward of the volcanic arc and is called back-arc spreading (Figure 3-14). The forces\\ninvolved must be extensional since the process is virtually identical to mid-ocean ridge\\nvolcanism. They also must be related to the slabs interaction with the overriding plate.\\nBut we often call the subduction process collision, so how can tension result in the back\\narc? One possible explanation is that the subducting plate “falls” into the mantle like a\\nwet towel laid onto the surface of a full tub of water. This results in a trench that migrates\\nseaward with time, pulling the volcanic arc away from the overriding plate. Whenever\\ntension opens rifts in the surface of the planet, mantle magma comes passively to the\\nsurface and a sea-floor spreading system begins.\\n', \"Examples of back-arc spreading are the Mariana Trough behind Guam in the\\nwestern Pacific, and closer to home, the Basin-and-Range province of the western United\\nStates. Finally, we have the beginnings of an explanation for the topography in Figure 3-7\\nabove.  Here, tension within the continent is from the Pacific plate's subduction beneath\\nthe Sierra Nevada range. This tension is pulling California to the west relative to\\nColorado. The result is faulting, which produces a series of north-south-aligned basins\\nseparated by ridges; thus the name Basin and Range. Extension inside continents only\\noccurs along faults; that is, no actual gaps have appeared along which mantle lavas can\\nreach the surface in large quantities. The whole basin is hot, with high heat flow at the\\nsurface indicating that the molten mantle is working its way closer and closer to the\\nsurface. Eventually, the continent could split apart, separating California from the eastern\\nUnited States. This is one example of how we are beginning to understand more and\\nmore of the continent.\\n\", '23\\n']\n"

This can happen due to various reasons such as volcanic activity, human activities like mining and drilling, or natural processes like plate tectonics. The movement of tectonic plates causes stress on the rocks beneath them, which eventually leads to the formation of fault lines. When these fault lines become overloaded with pressure, they can suddenly rupture, releasing energy in the form of seismic waves that cause earthquakes.\n",
